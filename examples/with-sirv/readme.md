# Example: Sirv

Tiny example that illustrates how to use [`sirv`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv) as an alternative to [`serve-static`](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static).

The `public` directory (configurable) contents are served by Polka as static assets.

All photos are fetched from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) via the `public/app.js` script.
